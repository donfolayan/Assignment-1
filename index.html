            Hello, my name is Folayan Donald Michael, I am a recent graduate
            with a degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the
            University of Ibadan with a strong interest in Cloud Engineering,
            specifically Cloud Security.

          <p>
            As a recent graduate from the University of Ibadan with a background
            in technology, I am excited to learn more about cloud systems and
            various techniques and technologies for securing them. My academic
            journey has been characterized by a persistent curiosity for
            learning, and I have consistently sought opportunities to enhance my
            skills. While my degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering has
            equipped me with a solid technical foundation, I believe Altshool
            will help me be the best I can be.
